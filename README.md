# Hello there
- Welcome to my virtual space ðŸ˜„
- I'm a software engineer who's interested in learning more about Distributed Computing, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Compilation. I've studied computer science and engineering from Netaji Subhash University of Technology, Delhi, India
- My interests and likings range from <font size = 5>*playing the piano to reading anything I can get my hands on!*</font>

### Current 
- I am working at VISA as a Software Engineer in the Big Data Services team, managing Spark over Kubernetes.
- I'm also an active contributor for [qBraid](https://www.qbraid.com/), developing their [qbraid-sdk](https://github.com/qBraid/qBraid/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ATheGupta2012+is%3Aclosed) and [qbraid-qir](https://github.com/qBraid/qbraid-qir/pull/54) packages. 

### Past Projects
- I developed a debugger for the qiskit transpiler under the [Unitary Fund Microgrant Program](https://unitary.fund/grants.html) and have worked at [Quanfluence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quanfluence/?trk=similar-pages) where I developed a C-based parser, preprocessor and data structures for representing QASM programs.
- I've also worked with Quantum Phase Estimation algorithms and developed a package consisting of many types of [phase estimation algorithms](https://github.com/TheGupta2012/QPE-Algorithms).
- Here's a [blog](https://harshitco19.wixsite.com/uncertainist) that I write to solidify some of my learnings.
