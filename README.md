# Hello there
- Welcome to my virtual space 
- I am a CSE undergrad from Netaji Subhash Univeristy of Technology, Delhi and have interests in all kinds of learning experiences.
- Currently I am learning more about photonic quantum computers and data structures for modelling the software stack.
- I am interested in learning more about Distributed Computing, Quantum Computing and Quantum Compilation.
- Here's a [blog](https://harshitco19.wixsite.com/uncertainist) that I write to solidify some of my learnings.
- I have also been learning fundamentals of classical computer systems too and my interests and likings range from <font size = 5>*playing the piano to reading Feynman*.</font>
