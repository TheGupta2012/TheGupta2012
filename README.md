# Hello there
- Welcome to my virtual space 
- I am currently a CSE undergrad from Netaji Subhash Univeristy of Technology, Delhi and have interests in all kinds of learning experiences. Currently I am working on strengthening my **algorithmic concepts** and learning about the *Quantum World*
- I have also been learning fundamentals of classical computer systems such as **Operating Systems and Theory of Computation** to name
a few. My interests and likings range from <font size = 5>*playing the piano and reading Feynman*.</font>
- Some my strongest skills are **Python, Data analysis, Mathematics, Machine learning algorithms, C++, HTML and CSS** and this list would surely be increasing.
