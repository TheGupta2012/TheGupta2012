# Hello there

- I am a CSE undergrad from Netaji Subhash University of Technology, Delhi, and have an interest in all kinds of learning experiences.
- Currently, I am working at VISA as a Data Engineer in the Big Data Services team, managing Spark over Kubernetes.
- I developed a debugger for the qiskit transpiler under the [Unitary Fund Microgrant Program](https://unitary.fund/grants.html) and have worked at [Quanfluence](https://www.linkedin.com/company/quanfluence/?trk=similar-pages) where I developed a C-based parser, preprocessor and data structures for representing QASM programs.
- I am interested in learning more about Distributed Computing, Quantum Computing, and Quantum Compilation.
- Here's a [blog](https://harshitco19.wixsite.com/uncertainist) that I write to solidify some of my learnings.
