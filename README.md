# Hello there
- Welcome to my humble virtual space 
- I am currently a CSE undergrad from Delhi and have avid interests in all kinds of learning experiences. Currently I am working on the MNIST data set
for handwriting recognition through deeplearning and learning from the <a href = "http://fast.ai"> fastai </a> course
- I have also been learning fundamentals of computer systems such as **Computer Organization, microprocessors and controllers** to name
a few. My interests and likings range from *playing the piano and reading Feynman*.
- Some my strongest skills are Python, Data analysis, Mathematics, Machine learning algorithms, C++(stl), C and this list would surely be increasing.
